# ats_mujoco_sim

MuJoCo-based chassis simulation migrated from the reference swerve chassis
project and adapted for the ATS workspace.

Main entry:

```bash
ros2 launch ats_mujoco_sim mujoco_navigation.launch.py
```

The default navigation launch generates a temporary random map, builds a
matching MuJoCo scene, starts the MuJoCo viewer, starts the MID360-pattern
sensor chain, starts Nav2, and opens a MuJoCo-specific RViz view.
Generated maps are written under `/tmp/ats_mujoco_sim_maps` by default; override
`output_root:=...` if you want to keep a specific scene.

Important topics:

1. `/localization` publishes simulated odometry.
2. `/local_pointcloud` publishes optional MID360-pattern point cloud data in the
   `front_mid360` frame when `enable_lidar:=true`.
3. `/perception/tof/points_merged` publishes optional side ToF point clouds.
4. `/simulation/PoseSub` accepts pose-reset commands.

LiDAR testing is intentionally fixed to Livox MID360:

```bash
ros2 launch ats_mujoco_sim planner_mujoco.launch.py \
  enable_lidar:=true lidar_model:=mid360 lidar_downsample:=1
```

`lidar_downsample` can be raised on slow CPUs. Other LiDAR scan patterns are
not accepted by `ats_mujoco_sim`.

Runtime Python dependencies are expected in the environment:

1. `mujoco`
2. `numpy`
3. `opencv-python` / `cv2`

The `mujoco_lidar` Python package from `~/参考/src/MuJoCo-LiDAR` is vendored into
this ROS2 package so lidar scan generation can be used without a separate clone.
